Aqua Scheme is a lightweight interpreter for a Scheme-like language, with a first class C API for embedding.  Inspired by projects like Lua and Chibi Scheme, Aqua Scheme seeks to be a powerful, expressive language that can fit into a tiny package.  

## Building

Currently, Aqua Scheme has only been tested on 64-bit Linux, but it is written in pure C99 with no external dependencies, so porting to other POSIX platforms should be smooth.

### Dependencies

* ``meson``
* ``ninja``

### Steps 

Clone the repo and enter it.
```
git clone https://github.com/garfr/aqua
```
```
cd aqua
```
Initialize the Meson build folder and enter it.
```
mkdir build
```
```
meson setup build
```

```
cd build/
```
Build the project.
```
ninja
```
The library will be placed in the ``build/`` directory as ``libaqua.so``, and an REPL executable that can be used to interact with the language will be placed in the same directory as ``aqua``.
